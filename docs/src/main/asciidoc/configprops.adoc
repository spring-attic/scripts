|eureka.client.log-delta-diff | false | Indicates whether to log differences between the eureka server and the eureka
 client in terms of registry information.

 Eureka client tries to retrieve only delta changes from eureka server to minimize
 network traffic. After receiving the deltas, eureka client reconciles the
 information from the server to verify it has not missed out some information.
 Reconciliation failures could happen when the client has had network issues
 communicating to server.If the reconciliation fails, eureka client gets the full
 registry information.

 While getting the full registry information, the eureka client can log the
 differences between the client and the server and this setting controls that.

 The changes are effective at runtime at the next registry fetch cycle as specified

|spring.sleuth.keys.http.host | http.host | The domain portion of the URL or host header. Example:
 "mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com". Used to filter by host as opposed to ip address.

|spring.sleuth.keys.http.method | http.method | The HTTP method, or verb, such as "GET" or "POST". Used to filter against an
 http route.

|spring.sleuth.keys.http.path | http.path | The absolute http path, without any query parameters. Example:
 "/objects/abcd-ff". Used to filter against an http route, portably with zipkin
 v1. In zipkin v1, only equals filters are supported. Dropping query parameters
 makes the number of distinct URIs less. For example, one can query for the same
 resource, regardless of signing parameters encoded in the query line. This does
 not reduce cardinality to a HTTP single route. For example, it is common to
 express a route as an http URI template like "/resource/{resource_id}". In
 systems where only equals queries are available, searching for
 {@code http.uri=/resource} won't match if the actual request was
 "/resource/abcd-ff". Historical note: This was commonly expressed as "http.uri"
 in zipkin, eventhough it was most often just a path.

 <p>Large downloads can exceed limits or contribute directly to latency.

|spring.sleuth.keys.http.status-code | http.status_code | The HTTP response code, when not in 2xx range. Ex. "503" Used to filter for
 error status. 2xx range are not logged as success codes are less interesting
 for latency troubleshooting. Omitting saves at least 20 bytes per span.

|spring.sleuth.keys.http.url | http.url | The entire URL, including the scheme, host and query parameters if available.
 Ex.
 "https://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/objects/abcd-ff?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256..."
 Combined with {@link #method}, you can understand the fully-qualified
 request line. This is optional as it may include private data or be of
 considerable length.

|spring.sleuth.keys.hystrix.thread-pool-key | threadPoolKey | Name of the thread pool key. The thread-pool key represents a {@link com.netflix.hystrix.HystrixThreadPool}
 for monitoring, metrics publishing, caching, and other such uses. A {@link com.netflix.hystrix.HystrixCommand}
 is associated with a single {@link com.netflix.hystrix.HystrixThreadPool} as
 retrieved by the {@link com.netflix.hystrix.HystrixThreadPoolKey} injected into it,
 or it defaults to one created using the {@link com.netflix.hystrix.HystrixCommandGroupKey}
 it is created with.

 @see com.netflix.hystrix.HystrixThreadPoolKey

|spring.sleuth.keys.message.headers |  | Additional headers that should be added as tags if they exist. If the header
 value is not a String it will be converted to a String using its toString()
 method.

|spring.sleuth.keys.message.payload.size | message/payload-size | An estimate of the size of the payload if available.

|spring.sleuth.keys.message.payload.type | message/payload-type | The type of the payload.

|spring.sleuth.keys.message.prefix | message/ | Prefix for header names if they are added as tags.

|spring.sleuth.keys.mvc.controller-class | mvc.controller.class | The lower case, hyphen delimited name of the class that processes the request.
 Ex. class named "BookController" will result in "book-controller" tag value.

|spring.sleuth.keys.mvc.controller-method | mvc.controller.method | The lower case, hyphen delimited name of the class that processes the request.

|zuul.host.max-total-connections | 200 | The maximum number of total connections the proxy can hold open to backends.

|zuul.ignore-local-service | true | 

|zuul.ignore-security-headers | true | Flag to say that SECURITY_HEADERS are added to ignored headers if spring security is on the classpath.
 By setting ignoreSecurityHeaders to false we can switch off this default behaviour. This should be used together with
 disabling the default spring security headers
 see https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/html/headers.html#default-security-headers

|zuul.ignored-headers |  | Names of HTTP headers to ignore completely (i.e. leave them out of downstream
 requests and drop them from downstream responses).

|zuul.s-e-c-u-r-i-t-y-h-e-a-d-e-r-s |  | Headers that are generally expected to be added by Spring Security, and hence often
 duplicated if the proxy and the backend are secured with Spring. By default they
 are added to the ignored headers if Spring Security is present and ignoreSecurityHeaders = true.

|zuul.semaphore.max-semaphores | 100 | The maximum number of total semaphores for Hystrix.

|zuul.sensitive-headers |  | List of sensitive headers that are not passed to downstream requests. Defaults to a
 "safe" set of headers that commonly contain user credentials. It's OK to remove
 those from the list if the downstream service is part of the same system as the
 proxy, so they are sharing authentication data. If using a physical URL outside
 your own domain, then generally it would be a bad idea to leak user credentials.

|zuul.servlet-path | /zuul | Path to install Zuul as a servlet (not part of Spring MVC). The servlet is more
 memory efficient for requests with large bodies, e.g. file uploads.

|zuul.ssl-hostname-validation-enabled | true | Flag to say whether the hostname for ssl connections should be verified or not. Default is true.
 This should only be used in test setups!

|zuul.strip-prefix | true | Flag saying whether to strip the prefix from the path before forwarding.
