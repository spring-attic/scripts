|eureka.client.log-delta-diff | false | Indicates whether to log differences between the eureka server and the eureka
 client in terms of registry information.

 Eureka client tries to retrieve only delta changes from eureka server to minimize
 network traffic. After receiving the deltas, eureka client reconciles the
 information from the server to verify it has not missed out some information.
 Reconciliation failures could happen when the client has had network issues
 communicating to server.If the reconciliation fails, eureka client gets the full
 registry information.

 While getting the full registry information, the eureka client can log the
 differences between the client and the server and this setting controls that.

 The changes are effective at runtime at the next registry fetch cycle as specified

|spring.sleuth.keys.async.class-name-key | class | Simple name of the class with a method annotated with {@code @Async}
 from which the asynchronous process started

 @see org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Async

|spring.sleuth.keys.async.method-name-key | method | Name of the method annotated with {@code @Async}

 @see org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Async

|spring.sleuth.keys.async.prefix |  | Prefix for header names if they are added as tags.

|spring.sleuth.keys.async.thread-name-key | thread | Name of the thread that executed the async method

 @see org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Async

|spring.sleuth.keys.http.headers |  | Additional headers that should be added as tags if they exist. If the header
 value is multi-valued, the tag value will be a comma-separated, single-quoted
 list.

|spring.sleuth.keys.http.host | http.host | The domain portion of the URL or host header. Example:
 "mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com". Used to filter by host as opposed to ip address.

|spring.sleuth.keys.http.method | http.method | The HTTP method, or verb, such as "GET" or "POST". Used to filter against an
 http route.

|spring.sleuth.keys.http.path | http.path | The absolute http path, without any query parameters. Example:
 "/objects/abcd-ff". Used to filter against an http route, portably with zipkin
 v1. In zipkin v1, only equals filters are supported. Dropping query parameters
 makes the number of distinct URIs less. For example, one can query for the same
 resource, regardless of signing parameters encoded in the query line. This does
 not reduce cardinality to a HTTP single route. For example, it is common to
 express a route as an http URI template like "/resource/{resource_id}". In
 systems where only equals queries are available, searching for
 {@code http.uri=/resource} won't match if the actual request was
 "/resource/abcd-ff". Historical note: This was commonly expressed as "http.uri"
 in zipkin, eventhough it was most often just a path.

|spring.sleuth.keys.http.prefix | http. | Prefix for header names if they are added as tags.

|spring.sleuth.keys.http.request-size | http.request.size | The size of the non-empty HTTP request body, in bytes. Ex. "16384"

 <p>Large uploads can exceed limits or contribute directly to latency.

|spring.sleuth.keys.http.response-size | http.response.size | The size of the non-empty HTTP response body, in bytes. Ex. "16384"

 <p>Large downloads can exceed limits or contribute directly to latency.

|spring.sleuth.keys.http.status-code | http.status_code | The HTTP response code, when not in 2xx range. Ex. "503" Used to filter for
 error status. 2xx range are not logged as success codes are less interesting
 for latency troubleshooting. Omitting saves at least 20 bytes per span.

|spring.sleuth.keys.http.url | http.url | The entire URL, including the scheme, host and query parameters if available.
 Ex.
 "https://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/objects/abcd-ff?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256..."
 Combined with {@link #method}, you can understand the fully-qualified
 request line. This is optional as it may include private data or be of
 considerable length.

|spring.sleuth.keys.hystrix.command-group | commandGroup | Name of the command group. Hystrix uses the command group key to group
 together commands such as for reporting, alerting, dashboards,
 or team/library ownership.

|spring.sleuth.keys.hystrix.command-key | commandKey | Name of the command key. Describes the name for the given command.
 A key to represent a {@link com.netflix.hystrix.HystrixCommand} for
 monitoring, circuit-breakers, metrics publishing, caching and other such uses.

 @see com.netflix.hystrix.HystrixCommandKey

|spring.sleuth.keys.hystrix.prefix |  | Prefix for header names if they are added as tags.

|spring.sleuth.keys.hystrix.thread-pool-key | threadPoolKey | Name of the thread pool key. The thread-pool key represents a {@link com.netflix.hystrix.HystrixThreadPool}
 for monitoring, metrics publishing, caching, and other such uses. A {@link com.netflix.hystrix.HystrixCommand}
 is associated with a single {@link com.netflix.hystrix.HystrixThreadPool} as
 retrieved by the {@link com.netflix.hystrix.HystrixThreadPoolKey} injected into it,
 or it defaults to one created using the {@link com.netflix.hystrix.HystrixCommandGroupKey}
 it is created with.

 @see com.netflix.hystrix.HystrixThreadPoolKey

|spring.sleuth.keys.message.headers |  | Additional headers that should be added as tags if they exist. If the header
 value is not a String it will be converted to a String using its toString()
 method.
