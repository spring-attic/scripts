The https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples[spring-cloud-samples] can be
run as a demo locally by just cloning the individual projects and
running them. This project can be used to manage updating and deploying
the sample apps to cloudfoundry.

[[running-locally]]
Running Locally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pre-requisites: Maven (3) and Java (1.7). To run the Customers UI you
also need the Spring Boot CLI. Clone the repository and initialize
submodules:

....
$ git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/scripts
$ cd scripts
$ ./build.sh
....

(You can add `-DskipTests' if you like, or just use `./mvnw' directly,
once the submodules are initialized. If you are starting from scratch,
the ``build'' module needs to be installed first, followed by the
``starters''.)

You also nee Mongodb and RabbitMQ and Redis. If you don’t have those,
and you do have Docker, you can run them in Docker (via
http://docs.docker.com/compose/[docker-compose]):

....
$ docker-compose up
...
<mongo starts up>
<rabbit starts up>
<redis starts up>
....

the containers for the server processes write their data locally in
`./data_*`. Those files will be owned by root, so watch out when it
comes to remove them.

*NOTE*: Docker version 1.5 and Compose version 1.1.0 are confirmed to
work. The latest versions have not been tested and may have problems.

[[docker-on-a-mac]]
Docker on a mac
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Docker on a mac requires boot2docker. Because docker is running in a
virtual machine, The ip addresses of mongo, rabbit and redis are not
127.0.0.1. You can use virtualbox port forwarding to address this issue
with the following commands (from
https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/blob/master/doc/WORKAROUNDS.md[here]):

....
# vm must be powered off
VBoxManage modifyvm "boot2docker-vm" --natpf1 "tcp-port27017,tcp,,27017,,27017"
VBoxManage modifyvm "boot2docker-vm" --natpf1 "tcp-port6379,tcp,,6379,,6379"
VBoxManage modifyvm "boot2docker-vm" --natpf1 "tcp-port15672,tcp,,15672,,15672"
VBoxManage modifyvm "boot2docker-vm" --natpf1 "tcp-port5672,tcp,,5672,,5672"
....

[[docker-alternative-on-a-mac]]
Docker alternative on a mac
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you prefer not to use docker-compose you can install mongo, rabbit
and redis:

....
brew install mongodb rabbitmq redis
....

To run the apps (each in a different terminal)

....
$ rabbitmq-server
$ mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf
$ redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf
....

Run the apps:

....
$ ./run.sh
....

You can kill the processes using `./kill.sh`, and both scripts know how
to operate on individual apps or subsets, e.g. (the default):

....
$ ./run.sh configserver eureka customers stores
....

To run the UI with the maps, get the Spring Boot CLI, and install the
platform CLI plugin, e.g. with GVM:

....
$ gvm install springboot 1.2.0.RC1
$ gvm use springboot 1.2.0.RC1
....

and finally install the Spring Cloud plugin:

....
$ spring install org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-cli:1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT
....

Then run the app

....
$ (cd customers-stores/customers-ui; spring run app.groovy)
....

[[running-on-cloud-foundry]]
Running on Cloud Foundry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pre-requisites:

* Maven (3)
* Java (1.8)
* the `cf` CLI
* Cloud Foundry with Java buildpack version 2.5 or greater (for Java 1.8
support)

Clone the repository and initialize submodules:

....
$ git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/scripts
$ cd scripts
$ ./build.sh
$ ./services_deploy.sh
$ ./demo_deploy.sh
....

The result should be a bunch of apps running in the default space for
your default org, with names prefixed by your local userid, e.g.

....
$ cf apps
...
dsyerconfigserver      started  1/1  512M  1G    dsyerconfigserver.cfapps.io
dsyereureka            started  1/1  512M  1G    dsyereureka.cfapps.io
dsyercustomers         started  1/1  512M  1G    dsyercustomers.cfapps.io
dsyerstores            started  1/1  512M  1G    dsyerstores.cfappps.io
...
....

The `configserver` and `eureka` apps will have been registered as user
provided services, and bound to the other apps:

....
$ cf services
...
name                 service        plan  bound apps
dsyerconfigserver   user-provided        dsyercustomers, dsyereureka, dsyerstores
dsyereureka         user-provided        dsyerconfigserver, dsyercustomers, dsyerstores
...
....

You can check that it is all working by pinging the `eureka` app
endpoints and seeing the other apps registered. E.g. visit
http://dsyereureka.cfapps.io/eureka/apps in a browser. Other useful
links for diagnosis and investigating what’s going on:

* http://dsyerconfigserver.cfapps.io/customers/cloud
* http://dsyercustomers.cfapps.io/env
* http://dsyerstores.cfapps.io/env

The stores app comes pre-populated with a Mongo database full of
Starbucks locations. The customers app is empty to start (and uses an
in-memory database) so you have to POST some data into it, e.g.

....
$ curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://dsyercustomers.cfapps.io/customers -d @customers-stores/rest-microservices-customers/src/test/resources/customers.json
....

Then when you visit the customers app at
http://dsyercustomers.cfapps.io/customers you should see a customer
(Ollie) and a link to nearby stores. If the stores app did not register
with eureka, or if you stop the the stores app intentionally
(`cf stop ...`), then the stores link will be missing in the customers
app (simple example of a circuit breaker).

Sometimes it is also useful to undeploy the services (and unbind them
from apps etc.), and redeploy them:

....
$ ./services_undeploy.sh
$ ./services_deploy.sh
$ ./demo_deploy.sh
....

It should all work on https://run.pivotal.io[Pivotal Web Services], by
default, or on any Cloudfoundry instance (e.g. PCF or a local single VM
instance) if you set the `DOMAIN` environment variable to the DNS domain
that the service is running in.

To run on https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite[bosh-lite]

Deploy mongodb using
https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/cf-services-contrib-release

....
export DOMAIN=10.244.0.34.xip.io
export PLATFORM_HOME=/Users/sgibb/workspace/spring/spring-cloud-samples #where all spring-cloud-samples are checked out
export MONGO_URI=mongodb://192.168.50.1/stores #mongo running on host #TODO install mongo as a service
....

[[build-documentation]]
Build documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can easily create the documentation for a particular release train
using the `release_train.sh` script. You can run it in an interactive
mode - then you’ll get prompted for all entries, or you can provide the
values of the name of the release train together with the names and
versions of modules. You can run `./release_train -h` for more
information.
